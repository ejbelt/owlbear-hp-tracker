# HP Tracker - Owlbear Plugin

This Repository contains an Extension for Owlbear Rodeo 2.0. This extension allows for tracking HP of characters and handling who can view this information.

![hp-tracker example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamejosh/owlbear-hp-tracker/master/docs/HP_Tracker.png)

## Installing

The extension can be installed manually, by pasting the [manifest link](https://hp-tracker.onrender.com/manifest.json) in the Add Extension dialog.

## How it works

This project uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the UI. It contains three different parts:

+ Hp Tracker window
+ Hp Tracker context menu
+ Hp Tracker background tasks

### Hp Tracker Window

This is a custom Action that can be opened on the top left to display all Characters HP and also change the current the settings for current HP, max HP, AC, name,...

Also when clicking on the name of a character the icon is tilted a little to make it easy to find on the map.

### Hp Tracker Context Menu

In the Context Menu the Active state of the Token in the HP Tracker Extension is toggled

When active two additional context menu items are available to increase or decrease the HP of the selected Token/s.

### Hp Tracker background Tasks

Handle setting defaults and subscribing and handling HP changes so they are propagated properly across all Views.

## Building

Can be built with `make build`, for development use `make run`.

## Contributing

I'm not sure how to handle contributions yet, Bug fixes are always welcome but features depend on backwards compatibility and maintaining a simple enough extension to use. But feel free to fork and open PRs.
