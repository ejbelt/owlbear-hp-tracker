# HP Tracker

A Tool to keep track of the HP/AC/Initiative of Character Tokens. With visibility options to hide information from players (like Boss HP).

Add Monster Sheets (using the Open5e API) to your monster tokens, with easy search and click. To have all stats and a bilities on one screen. 

You can hide or display only an HP Bar to indicate the HP Status without revealing too much information, or hide all information entirely from your characters.

Reordering the Tokenlist via Drag and Drop (for GMs only) is possible, without changing the order in the list visible by the player.

For activated Tokens the HP can be changed directly in the context menu of the Token (also for multiple tokens at the same time).
